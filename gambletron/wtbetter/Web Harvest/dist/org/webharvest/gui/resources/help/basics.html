<p>Web-Harvest is <em>Open Source Web Data Extraction tool</em>
written in Java. It offers a way to collect desired Web pages and
extract useful data from them. In order to do that, it leverages well
established techniques and technologies for text/xml manipulation such
as <em>XSLT</em>, <em>XQuery</em> and <em>Regular Expressions</em>.
Web-Harvest mainly focuses on HTML/XML based web sites which still make
vast majority of the Web content. On the other hand, it could be easily
supplemented by custom Java libraries in order to augment its extraction
capabilities.</p>
<p>Process of extracting data from Web pages is also referred as <em>Web
Scraping</em> or <em>Web Data Mining</em>. World Wide Web, as the largest
database, often contains various data that we would like to consume for
our needs. The problem is that this data is in most cases mixed together
with formatting code - that way making human-friendly, but not
machine-friendly content. Doing manual copy-paste is error prone,
tedious and sometimes even impossible. Web software designers usually
discuss how to make clean separation between content and style, using
various frameworks and design patterns in order to achieve that. Anyway,
some kind of merge occurs usually at the server side, so that the bunch
of HTML is delivered to the web client.</p>
<p>Every Web site and every Web page is composed using some logic.
It is therefore needed to describe reverse process - how to fetch
desired data from the mixed content. Every extraction procedure in
Web-Harvest is user-defined through XML-based <em>configuration
files</em>. Each configuration file describes sequence of <em>processors</em>
executing some common task in order to accomplish the final goal.
Processors execute in the form of <em>pipeline</em>. Thus, the output of
one processor execution is input to another one. This can be best
explained using the simple configuration fragment:</p>

<br>
<div><pre>&lt;xpath expression="//a[@shape='rect']/@href"&gt;
    &lt;html-to-xml&gt;
        &lt;http url="http://www.somesite.com/"/&gt;
    &lt;/html-to-xml&gt;
&lt;/xpath&gt;</pre></div>

<p>When Web-Harvest executes this part of configuration, the
following steps occur:</p>
<ol>
	<li><em>http</em> processor downloads content from the specified
	URL.</li>
	<li><em>html-to-xml</em> processor cleans up that HTML producing
	XHTML content.</li>
	<li><em>xpath</em> processor searches specific links in XHTML from
	previous step giving URL sequence as a result.</li>
</ol>

<p>Web-Harvest supports a set of useful processors for variable
manipulation, conditional branching, looping, functions, file
operations, HTML and XML processing, exception handling.</p>
