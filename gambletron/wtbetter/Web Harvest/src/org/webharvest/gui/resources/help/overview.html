<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>World Wide Web, though by far the largest knowledge base, is
rarely regarded as database in traditional sense - as source of
information used for further computing. Web-Harvest is inspired by
practical need for having right data at the right time. And very often,
the Web is the only source that publicly provides wanted information.</p>

<h3>Basic concept</h3>
<p>The main goal behind Web-Harvest is to empower the usage of
already existing extraction technologies. Its purpose is not to propose
a new method, but to provide a way to easily use and combine the
existing ones. Web-Harvest offers the set of <em>processors</em> for
data handling and control flow. Each processor can be regarded as a
function - it has zero or more input parameters and gives a result after
execution. Processors could be combined in a <em>pipeline</em>, making
the chain of execution. For easier manipulation and data reuse
Web-Harvest provides <em>variable context</em> where named variables are
stored. The following diagram describes one pipeline execution:</p>

<div>
<center><img src="diagram1.gif" /></center>
</div>

<p>The result of extraction could be available in files created
during execution or from the variable context if Web-Harvest is
programmatically used.</p>

<h3>Configuration language</h3>
<p>Every extraction process is defined in one or more <em>configuration
files</em>, using simple XML-based language. Each processor is described by
specific XML element or structure of XML elements. For the illustration,
here is presented an example of configuration file:</p>

<br>
<div><pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;config charset="UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;var-def name="urlList"&gt;
        &lt;xpath expression="//img/@src"&gt;
            &lt;html-to-xml&gt;
                &lt;http url="http://news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;
            &lt;/html-to-xml&gt;
        &lt;/xpath&gt;
    &lt;/var-def&gt;

    &lt;loop item="link" index="i" filter="unique"&gt;
        &lt;list&gt;
            &lt;var name="urlList"/&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            &lt;file action="write" type="binary" path="images/${i}.gif"&gt;
                &lt;http url="${sys.fullUrl('http://news.bbc.co.uk', link)}"/&gt;
            &lt;/file&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/loop&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;</pre></div>
<br>

<div>This configuration contains two pipelines. The first pipeline
performs the following steps:
<ol>
	<li>HTML content at <em>http://news.bbc.co.uk</em> is downloaded,</li>
	<li>HTML cleaning is performed on downloaded content producing
	XHTML,</li>
	<li>XPath expression is searched for, giving URL sequence of page
	images,</li>
	<li>New variable named "<em>urlList</em>" is defined containing
	sequence of image URLs.</li>
</ol>
The second pipeline uses result of the previous execution in order to
collect all page images:
<ol>
	<li><em>Loop</em> processor iterates over URL sequence and for
	every item:</li>
	<li>Downloads image at current URL,</li>
	<li>Stores the image on the file system.</li>
</ol>

This example illustrates some procedural-language elements of
Web-Harvest, like variable definition and list iteration, few data
management processors (<em>file</em> and <em>http</em>) and couple of
HTML/XML processing instructions (<em>html-to-xml</em> and <em>xpath</em>
processors).</div>

<h3>Data values</h3>
<p>All data produced and consumed during extraction process in
Web-Harvest have three representations: text, binary and list. There is
also special data value <em>empty</em>, whose textual representation is
empty string, binary - empty byte array and list - zero length list.
Which form of data is used - it depends on processor that consumes the
data. In previous configuration <em>html-to-xml</em> processor uses
downloaded content as text in order to transform it to HTML, <em>loop</em>
processor uses variable <em>urlList</em> as a list in order to iterate
over it and <em>file</em> processor treats downloaded images as binary
data when saving them to the files. In most cases proper representation
of the data is chosen by Web-Harvest. However - in some situations it
must be explicitly stated which one to use. One example is <em>file</em>
processor where default data type is <em>text</em> and the binary
content must be explicitly specified with <code>type="binary"</code>.</p>

<h3>Variables</h3>
<p>Web-Harvest provides the variable context for storing and using
variables. There is no special convention for naming variables like in
most of the programming languages. Thus, the names like <em>arr[1]</em>,
<em>100</em> or <em>#$&</em> are valid. However, if aforementioned
variables were used in scripts or templates (see next section), where
expressions are dynamically evaluated, the exception would be thrown. It
is therefore recommended to use usual programming language naming in
order to avoid any difficulties.</p>
<p>When Web-Harvest is programmatically used (from Java code, not
from command line) variable context may be initially set by user in
order to add custom values and functionality. Similarly, after
execution, variable context is available for taking variables from it.</p>
<p>When <em>user-defined functions</em> are called, separate local
variable context is created (like in many programming languages,
including Java). The valid way to exchange data between caller and
called function is through the function parameters.</p>


<h3>Scripting and templating</h3>
<p>Besides the set of powerful text and XML manipulation processors,
Web-Harvest supports real scripting languages which code can be easily
intergrated within scraper configurations. Languages currently supported
are <em>BeanShell</em>, <em>Groovy</em> and <em>Javascript</em>.
BeanShell is probably the closest to Java syntax and power, but <em>Groovy</em>
and <em>Javascript</em> have some other adventages. It is up to the
developer to use prefered language or even to mix different languages in
the single configuration.</p>
<p>Templating allowes evaluating of marked parts of the text (text
"islands" surrounded with <em>${</em> and <em>}</em>). Evaluation is
performed using the chosen scripting language. In Web-Harvest all
elements' attributes are implicitly passed to the templating engine. In
upper configuration, there are two places where templater is doing the
job:</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>path="images/${i}.gif"</code> in <em>file</em>
	processor, producing file names based on loop index,</li>
	<li><code>url="${sys.fullUrl('http://news.bbc.co.uk',
	link)}"</code> in <em>http</em> processor, where built-in functionality is
	called to calculate full URL of the image.</li>
</ul>
