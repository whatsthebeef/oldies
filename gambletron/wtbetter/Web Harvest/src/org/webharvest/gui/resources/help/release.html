<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Graphical user interface is introduced giving the environment
	for easier configuration development and testing.</li
	<li><code>html-to-xml</code> processor, which is based on
	HtmlCleaner, now exposes attributes for controlling cleaner's
	behaviour.</li>
	<li>Besides <code>BeanShell</code> scripting engine, two others
	are added: Groovy and JavaScript. Now it is possible to choose the
	favourite scripting engine or even mix them in a single Web-Harvest
	configuration. This option is supported by adding new attributes to <code>config</code>,
	<code>script</code> and <code>template</code> processors.</li>
	<li>Access to HTTP client is supported by introducing implicit
	context varibale <code>http</code>. Now it is possible to check
	important HTTP response values, like <code>http.mimeType</code>, <code>http.headers</code>,
	<code>http.statusCode</code>, or even to obtain instance of <code>org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpClient</code>
	class with <code>http.client</code> and manipulate it in the runtime.</li>
	<li>New attribute <code>cookie-policy</code> added to the <code>http</code>
	processor, specifying the way HttpClient manage cookies.</li>
	<li>Command-line use is improved by adding several new parameters.
	</li>
	<li>For more comfortable use of Web-Harvest context variables in
	the script engines' runtime scopes, several handy methods are added to
	the class org.webharvest.runtime.variables.Variable (interface <code>IVariable</code>
	in previous versions of Web-Harvest).</li>
	<li>Several useful methods added in implicit Web-Harvest context
	variable <code>sys</code>, like <code>sys.xpath(expression, xml)</code>,
	<code>sys.isVariableDefined(varname)</code> and <code>sys.defineVariable(varName,
	varValue, [overwrite])</code>.</li>
	<li>Attribute <code>overwrite</code> added in the <code>ver-def</code>
	processor, giving possibility to specify whether existing variables
	with specified name will be overwriten or not.</li>
	<li>New proccessor <code>&lt;exit condition=...
	message=.../&gt;</code> is introduced in order to support conditional
	execution break.</li>
	<li>Encoding selection in <code>http</code> processor is changed -
	if no explicitely specified with <code>charset</code> attribute, one
	given from HTTP response is used instead to read downloaded text
	content.</li>
	<li>NTLM proxy authentication scheme is supported.</li>
	<li>Performance improvements and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Version 0.5</h3>

<ul>
	<li><code>html-to-xml</code> parser is changed - HtmlCleaner is
	used instead of TagSoup. The bad point in this is that some existing
	Web-Harvest configurations may need corrections of XPath or XQuery
	processors. On the other hand, lot of problems previously existing are
	now solved.</li>
	<li>Script processor is introduced. It adds scripting support
	based on BeanShell scripting language.</li>
	<li><code>template</code> processor is now based also on BeanShell
	instead of OGNL, this way giving possibilty to share the same variables
	and methods with script processing.</li>
	<li>Optional attribute <code>type</code> is now added to <code>xq-param</code>
	defaulting to <code>node()</code>. It specifies type of external XQuery
	parameter. Up to the Web-Harvest 0.5 this parameter was implicitely
	declared at the beginning of XQuery expression and was always of <code>node()*</code>
	type. Now on, for each parameter defined with <code>xq-param</code> the
	matching explicit declaration inside <code>xq-expression</code> is
	required (<code>declare variable $var_name as var_type external;</code>).
	</li>
	<li>A couple of new constructors is added to the class <code>ScraperConfiguration</code>
	allowing loading configuration from URL or from arbitrary input stream.
	</li>
	<li><code>file</code> and <code>include</code> processors now
	support both absolute and relative paths. File paths are regarded as
	absolute if they begin with <code>X:</code>, <code>/</code>, or <code>\</code>,
	where X is a letter.</li>
	<li>In order to avoid ambiguity in exchanging values with <code>script</code>
	and <code>template</code> processing, Web-Harvest variables are
	case-sensitive from this version.</li>
</ul>
